* MooseFS 1.6.0 (not released - only available in public repository)

 Common:
 - Removed duplicate source files.
 - Strip whitespace at the end of configuration file lines.

 Chunkserver:
 - Rewritten in multi-threaded model.
 - Added periodical chunk testing functionality (HDD_TEST_FREQ option).
 - New -v option (prints version and exits).

 Master:
 - Added "noowner" objects flag (causes objects to belong to current user).
 - Maintaining `mfsdirinfo` data online, so it doesn't need to be calculated
   on every request.
 - Filesystem access authorization system (NFS-like mfsexports.cfg file,
   REJECT_OLD_CLIENTS option) with ro/rw, password and maproot
   functionality.
 - New -v option (prints version and exits).

 Mount:
 - Rewritten options parsing in mount-like way, making possible to use
   standard FUSE mount utilities (see mfsmount(8) manual for new syntax).
   Note: old syntax is no longer accepted and mountpoint is mandatory now
   (there is no default).
 - Updated for FUSE 2.6+.
 - Added password, file data cache, attribute cache and entry cache options.
   By default attribute cache and directory entry cache are enabled,
   file data cache and file entry cache are disabled.
 - opendir() no longer reads directory contents - it's done on first
   readdir() now; fixes "rm -r" on recent Linux/glibc/coreutils combo.
 - Fixed mtime setting just before close() (by flushing file on mtime
   change); fixes mtime preserving on "cp -p".
 - Added statistics accessible through MFSROOT/.stats pseudo-file.
 - Changed master access method for mfstools (direct .master pseudo-file
   replaced by .masterinfo redirection); fixes possible mfstools race
   condition and allows to use mfstools on read-only filesystem.

 Tools:
 - Units cleanup in values display (exact values, IEC-60027/binary prefixes,
   SI/decimal prefixes); new options: -n, -h, -H and MFSHRFORMAT environment
   variable - refer to mfstools(8) manual for details).
 - mfsrgetgoal, mfsrsetgoal, mfsrgettrashtime, mfsrsettrashtime have been
   deprecated in favour of new "-r" option for mfsgetgoal, mfssetgoal,
   mfsgettrashtime, mfssettrashtime tools.
 - mfssnapshot utility replaced by mfsappendchunks (direct descendant of
   old utility) and mfsmakesnapshot (which creates "real" recursive
   snapshots and behaves similar to "cp -r").
 - New mfsfilerepair utility, which allows partial recovery of file with
   some missing or broken chunks.

 CGI scripts:
 - First public version of CGI scripts allowing to monitor MFS installation
   from WWW browser.
